					<p>
						When your SR&ED process runs the way it should, everything moves faster. You scale with
						confidence, hire without hesitation, and stop guessing when funding will land. Filing
						becomes a formality, not an annual disruption.
					</p>
					<p>
						But when it doesn't work? You don't just lose money. You risk a CRA audit and potential
						blacklisting from the SR&ED program.

<CaseStudy

We stepped in, rebuilt their claim from the ground up, and got them approved with $190,000 with less than five hours of work from their team."
