    "prompt": "A Canadian founder sits at a modern office desk, celebrating a breakthrough moment with a quietly confident smile. The workspace features warm natural lighting with subtle indigo and golden hour accents, creating dramatic high-contrast shadows and highlights. The scene is captured with an editorial, documentary feel—slightly unconventional angle and generous negative space suggest possibility and transformation.
